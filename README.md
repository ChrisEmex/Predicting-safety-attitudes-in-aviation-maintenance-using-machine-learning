# Predicting-safety-attitudes-in-aviation-maintenance-using-machine-learning
This study explores the application of machine learning techniques in predicting safety attitudes among aviation
maintenance personnel. Personality traits and demographic information are used for this purpose, with data
obtained from an online dataset. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was utilised to identify the
relationships and to enable predictions. The obtained results indicated that extraversion had the most positive
influence, followed closely by openness. On the other hand, neuroticism had the most negative impact. Total
years of experience and experience in the current role are, on the other hand, the most influential demographic
information. Combining personality traits with demographic information can improve safety attitude predictions.
Nevertheless, definitive causal inferences cannot be established, as further analysis is required to verify
the suitability of the Random Forest algorithm relative to other machine learning algorithms.
